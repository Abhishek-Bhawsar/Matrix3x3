# React + Vite

This project is a simple 3x3 interactive matrix built using React.js. Each box in the grid initially has a white background.

When a box is clicked, its color changes to green.

Once all 9 boxes are clicked, they turn orange in the sequence in which they were clicked.

A Reset button is provided to reset the grid to its original state.
